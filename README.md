## About:
It is a small simple project that implements the RSA encryption algorithm , to encrypt / decrypt small messages using generated private keys, hence allowing encrypted communication between people.
## Working:
The working of the project can be broken into loosely coupled
procedures:
1. Generate RSA Key from user salt.
2. Save both public / private key to file.
3. Now the program does two function:

    1.   Encrypt Message to Disk.
    2.   Decrypt Encrypted Message on Disk.
   
4. Procedure for Encrypting Message to Disk:
    1.  perform input of message from user.
    2.  use “RSABlock” encryption algorithm to encrypt message.
    3.  Save encrypted message to disk.
5. Procedure for Decrypting Encrypted Message on Disk:
    1.  read encrypted message from disk.
    2.  use “RSABlock” decryption algorithm to decrypt the encrypted message.
    3. display the decrypted message to user.
6. The decrypting operation only works if a private key is loaded.
7. The encrypting operation works on both keys.

### Working of RSA Key Generation:
This is the part of program handled by ( `class : RSAGenerator` ), this
part is responsible for creation of public and private keys that are
needed for algorithm.
Procedure:
1. take salt input from user.
2. generate two coprime numbers.
3. feed these numbers to RSA_KEY_GENERATION algorithm.
4. generated ( `class : RSAGenerator` ) object is feed to ( `class : RSAKey` )
object.
5. once keys are generated the keygen object is no longer
needed as the keys exist on their own.

### Working of RSABlock Encryption:
This is the part of program handled by ( class : RSABlockKey ), this
part is responsible for encrypting large chunks of data, which is
not support by vanilla RSA Algorithm.
Procedure:
1. the algorithm converts any object/string/datatype into an char
array ( `char ptr` pointing to mloc of the object/datatype ).
2. the algorithm runs sequentially on each item of the array ( `char
ptr` ),and encrypts/decrypts them by RSA algorithm.
3. the encrypted/decrypted message can be stored or read from
disk using custom methods provided in the class.
4. The blockkey requires RSAKey to perform
encryption/decryption.

## Header Files
The overall program has used the following header files:
1. iostream.h
2. fstream.h
3. math.h
4. thread.h
5. chrono.h

The program internally contains two header files:
* RSA.h:
Responsible for implementing RSA,RSABlock Algorithm.
* Loader.h
Responsible for generating custom loading screen.

### Files Generated By Program

The program generated two category of file of which each is an
binary file.
Key Files:
These files are responsible for storing the generated public and
private key:
1. `<key-name>.key.dat` :
This file stores the private key.<key-name> denotes name of key.Ex.
Private key pbm is stored as : “pbm.key.dat”.
2. `<key-name>.public.key.dat` :
This file stores the public key. <key-name> denotes name of key.
Ex. Public key sbm is stored as : “sbm.public.key.dat”.

Message Files:
`<msg-name>.msg.dat` : this stores the encrypted form of message in
binary format. `<msg-name>` denotes name of message.
Ex. Message cipho is stored as “cipho.msg.data”
